Number Guessing Game
Overview
This project is an interactive Number Guessing Game written in Python, featuring scoring and difficulty levels. Players are challenged to guess a randomly generated number while earning points based on their performance. The game includes three difficulty levels, each with varying ranges and limits on the number of attempts.

Features
Difficulty Levels:
Easy: Wide range (1-100) and unlimited attempts.
Medium: Medium range (1-50) with a maximum of 10 attempts.
Hard: Small range (1-20) with a maximum of 5 attempts.


Scoring System:
Points are awarded based on the number of attempts and the chosen difficulty level.
Higher difficulty levels offer more points.


Input Validation:
Ensures only valid numeric inputs are accepted.
Interactive feedback for incorrect guesses, guiding players toward the correct number.


Requirements
Python 3.x installed on your system.


How to Play
Run the script in a Python environment.

Select a difficulty level:
Enter 1 for Easy, 2 for Medium, or 3 for Hard.
The program will generate a random number within the specified range.


Enter your guesses:
If the guess is too low or too high, youâ€™ll be prompted to try again.
If the guess is correct, the game displays the number of attempts and your score.
The game ends when you guess correctly or run out of attempts (on Medium and Hard levels).
